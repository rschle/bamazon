# bamazon

This app functions just like amazon and allows the user to choose to order an item from a select list in node. Once the user chooses a quantity of the item, a comparison is made to the stock quantity, which we have predefined (along with the inventory) in an mySQL database, and if there is a sufficient quantity, the order is complete and the table for the inventory is updated to show the leftover stock for that item. Otherwise, it will show that there is an insufficient quantity.
